# START WITH THE MAIN BRANCH
All feature brnaches are created off the latest code state of a project.
git checkout main
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/main
This switches the repo to the main branch, pulls the latest commits and resets the repo's local copy of main to match the latest version
