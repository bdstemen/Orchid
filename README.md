# Create a new-branch
Use a separate branch for each feature or issue you work on. After creating a branch, check it out locally so that any changes you make will be on that branch.

git checkout -b new-feature
This checks out a branch called new-feature based on main, and the -b flag tells Git to create the branch if it doesnâ€™t already exist.
